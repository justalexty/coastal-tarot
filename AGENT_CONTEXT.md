**Created**: March 14, 2026  
**Repository**: github.com/justalexty/coastal-tarot  
**Development Stage**: Early prototype with core systems

## Game Concept
A broke witch trying to make $700 monthly rent by reading tarot cards in an expensive coastal city. The player starts with only $25 and a broken broom, building up their tarot reading business while managing energy, reputation, and finances.

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Daily Card System
- Every morning starts with drawing a personal tarot card
- Cards provide bonuses (never penalties) that affect the whole day

### ✅ Calendar System  
- Game starts March 1st
- Tracks real weekdays, months, lunar cycles
- Rent due on 1st of each month ($700)
- Major holidays: Lunar New Year (biggest!), Equinoxes, Solstices
- Location: `scripts/systems/calendar_system.gd`

### ✅ Character System
- Inclusive character creation with pronouns (she/he/they/custom)
- Body type selection (feminine/neutral/masculine)
- Dynamic text replacement throughout game
- Location: `scripts/systems/pronoun_manager.gd`

### ✅ Economy System

## Current Demo State (v3 - Train Arrival Update)
- Main menu → Train arrival scene → Compact mirror character creation → Train station → Daily card → Studio apartment
- Train arrival has 5 dialogue sequences about arriving broke

- Train station is first explorable location (walk left to exit)
- Basic movement (WASD) and interaction (E)
- Calendar widget shows date/moon/rent countdown
- Can run with `godot project.godot` and press F5

### Character Customization System (NEW)
- Full character customization system that works with ANY sprite pack
- Compact mirror UI with live preview
- Options: body type, skin tone, hair style/color, outfit
- Using placeholder sprites (colored shapes) until real assets chosen
- Ready for Seliel's sprites, LPC, or custom art
- See `character_customization_guide.md` for implementation details

## Architecture Decisions

### Singletons (Autoload)
- GameState - Global game state
- Calendar - Date/time management  
- DailyCardSystem - Morning ritual
- TarotDeck - Card data and drawing
- PronounManager - Text replacement

### Design Philosophy
- **No punishment mechanics** - Cards give information, not penalties
- **Player agency** - Choices matter but aren't moral judgments
- **Contemporary magical realism** - Not derivative fantasy
- **Respectful monetization** - No addiction mechanics

## Next Development Steps
1. **City Map Navigation** - Multiple locations to read tarot
2. **Tarot Reading Gameplay** - The actual card reading mechanics
3. **Client Generation** - Different client types with unique needs
4. **Weather System** - Makes walking without broom difficult
5. **Save/Load System** - Persistence between sessions

## Important Context
- Alex prefers concise responses
- The game should feel cozy and supportive, never punishing
- Lunar New Year is the most important holiday
- All notifications must be opt-in
- Sleep should always restore energy to full
- Brooms removed: Northern Pine, Mountain Pine (redundant)

## Technical Notes
- Godot 4.6+ required
- Target platforms: Web (itch.io), Desktop
- Mobile support planned but not priority
- Art style: Not yet defined, using color blocks
