# Coastal Witch Tarot Game

A cozy Ghibli-inspired game about a young witch building her tarot reading business in a coastal city.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Godot 4.2+ (download from godotengine.org)
- Aseprite or similar for pixel art (optional)
- Git for version control

### Getting Started
1. Open Godot and import this project
2. The main scene will be in `scenes/main_menu/main_menu.tscn`
3. Run the project to see the opening sequence

## Art Direction

### Character Sprites - Better Than LPC for This Project

For the Ghibli aesthetic, I recommend **NOT** using LPC sprites. Here's why and what to use instead:

**UPDATE**: Character customization system is now built and ready! It works with ANY sprite system - just drop in the assets. Currently using placeholder sprites for testing.

#### Option 1: Seliel's Sprites (Recommended)
- **Link**: https://seliel-the-shaper.itch.io/character-base
- **Why**: More anime/Ghibli proportions, cleaner style
- **License**: Free with attribution
- **Customization**: Easy to modify in Aseprite

#### Option 2: Time Fantasy Style
- **Link**: https://finalbossblues.com/time-fantasy/
- **Why**: Beautiful hand-drawn style, perfect for cozy games
- **License**: Paid but worth it for professional look
- **Note**: Has matching tilesets for environments

#### Option 3: Custom Sprite Base
Create your own base in this style:
- **Size**: 32x48 pixels (taller proportions than LPC)
- **Style**: Large head, expressive eyes, flowing clothes
- **Key Frames**: Idle (breathing), Walk (8 frames), Sit, Shuffle cards
- **Layers**: Base body, Hair (front/back), Outfit, Accessories
